## Background
Pertussis (a.k.a. whooping cough) is a common lung infection caused by the bacteria *B. Pertussis*. The CDC tracks cases of Pertussis in the US: https://tinyrul.com/pertussiscdc

## Examining cases of Pertussis by year

We can use the **datapasta** package to scrape case numbers from the CDC website.

> Q. Make a plot of Pertussis cases per year using ggplot.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

cases <- ggplot(cdc) +
  aes(year, cases) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line()

cases
```

> Q. Add some key time points in our history of interaction with Pertussis. These include wP rollout (the first vaccine) in 1946 and the switch to aP in 1996.

We can use `geom_vline()` for this.
```{r}
cases + geom_vline(xintercept = 1946, col = "blue") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 1996, col = "red") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 2020, col = "purple")
```

> Q. Describe what happened after the introduction of the aP vaccine? Do you have a possible explanation for the observed trend?

After the introduction of the wP vaccine (1946), case numbers of Pertussis rapidly declined. However, cases once again increased after the introduction of the aP vaccine (1996). Potential reasons for this include vaccine hesitancy, bacterial evolution, or that the aP vaccine protection wanes more rapidly compared to the wP vaccine.

## Enter the CMI-PB project

CMI-PB (computational models of Immunity - Pertussis boost) major goal is to investigate how the immune system responds differently to aP vs wP vaccinated individuals and be able to predict this at an early stage.

CMI-PB makes all their collected data freely available and they store it in a database compoased of different tables. Here we will acess a few of these.

We can use the **jsonlite** package to read this data
```{r}
library(jsonlite)

subject <- read_json("https://www.cmi-pb.org/api/v5_1/subject", simplifyVector = TRUE)

head(subject)
```

> Q. How many subjects (i.e. enrolled people) are there in this dataset?

```{r}
nrow(subject)
```

> Q. How many "aP" and "wP" subjects are there?

```{r}
table(subject$infancy_vac)
```

> Q. How many Male/Female subjects are in the dataset?

```{r}
table(subject$biological_sex)
```

> Q. What is the breakdown of race and biological sex?

```{r}
table(subject$race, subject$biological_sex)
```

> Q. Is this representative of the US population?

No! Rather, it's representative of the population of UCSD students.

Let's read another database table from CMI-PB.

```{r}
specimen <- read_json("https://www.cmi-pb.org/api/v5_1/specimen", simplifyVector = TRUE)

ab_data <- read_json("http://cmi-pb.org/api/v5_1/plasma_ab_titer", simplifyVector = TRUE)
```

A quick look at the data

```{r}
head(specimen)
```

We want to "join" these tables to get all our information together. For this we will use the **dplyer** package and the `inner_join()` function.

```{r}
library(dplyr)

meta <- inner_join(subject, specimen)

head(meta)
```

```{r}
head(ab_data)
```

One more "join" to get ab_data and meta all together
```{r}
abdata <- inner_join(ab_data, meta)
head(abdata)
```

```{r}
dim(abdata)
```

> Q. How many Ab isotypes are there in the dataset?

```{r}
table(abdata$isotype)
```


> Q. How many different antigens are measured in the dataset?

```{r}
table(abdata$antigen)
```

Measles is the control (very low expected response).

> Q. What are the different $dataset values in abdata and what do you notice about the number of rows for the most “recent” dataset?

```{r}
table(abdata$dataset)
```

The number of rows in the 2023 dataset is the second highest.

> Q. Make a boxplot of antigen levels across the whole dataset (MFI vs. antigen).

```{r}
ggplot(abdata) +
  aes(MFI, antigen) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

> Q. Are there obvious differences between the aP and wP values?

```{r}
ggplot(abdata) +
  aes(MFI, antigen, col=infancy_vac) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

## Focus on IgG levels

```{r}
igg <- abdata |> filter(isotype == "IgG")

head(igg)
```

Same boxplot of antigens as before

```{r}
ggplot(abdata) +
  aes(MFI_normalised, antigen, col=infancy_vac) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_wrap(~visit)
```

Focus in further in just one of these antigens - let's pick PT (Pertussis Toxin, one of the main toxins of the bacteria) in the **2021_dataset** again for **IgG** antibody isotypes.

```{r}
table(igg$dataset)
```

```{r}
pt_igg <- abdata |> filter(isotype == "IgG", antigen == "PT", dataset == "2021_dataset")
```

```{r}
dim(pt_igg)
```

```{r}
ggplot(pt_igg) +
  aes(actual_day_relative_to_boost, MFI_normalised, col=infancy_vac, group=subject_id) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  theme_bw() +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 14)
```
