## Section 4: Population Scale Analysis

One sample is obviously not enough to know what is happening in a
population. You are interested in assessing genetic differences on a
population scale. So, you processed about ~230 samples and did the
normalization on a genome level. Now, you want to find whether there is
any association of the 4 asthma-associated SNPs (rs8067378â€¦) on ORMDL3
expression.

``` r
library(ggplot2)
```

``` r
ggplot(expr) + aes(x=geno, y=exp, fill=geno) +
  geom_boxplot(notch=TRUE) +
  labs(x = "Genotype", y = "Expression Level")
```

![](class12hw_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png)

Having G/G in this location is associated with having a reduced
expression of ORMDL3 (no overlap in notches, significant difference);
yes, SNP does impact gene expression.
