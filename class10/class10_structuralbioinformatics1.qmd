## Introduction to the RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB)

The main repository of biomolecular structure data is called the [Protein Data Bank](https://www.rcsb.org/) (PDB). It is the second oldest database (after GenBank).

What is currently in the PDB? [here](https://www.rcsb.org/stats/summary)

```{r}
stats <- read.csv("Data Export Summary.csv", row.names = 1)
head(stats)
```


> Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.

```{r}
x <- stats$X.ray
y <- gsub(",", "", x)
sum(as.numeric(y))
```

Turn this snippet into a function so I can use it any time I have this comma problem (i.e. the other colums of this `stats` table).

```{r}
comma.sum <- function(x) {y <- gsub(",", "", x)
sum(as.numeric(y))
}
```

```{r}
xray.sum <- comma.sum(stats$X.ray)
em.sum <- comma.sum(stats$EM)
total.sum <- comma.sum(stats$Total)
```

```{r}
xray.sum/total.sum * 100
```
```{r}
em.sum/total.sum * 100
```

> Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

```{r}
protein.sum <- comma.sum(stats[1,7])
total.protein.sum <- comma.sum(stats[,7])
protein.sum/total.protein.sum * 100
```

## Visualizing with Mol-star

Explore the HIV-1 protease structure with PDB code: `1HSG`
Mol-star homepage at: https://molstar.org/viewer/.

![Figure 1. A first view of HIV-Pr](1HSG.png)

![Figure 2. Molecular surface showing binding cavity](1HSG_1.png)

![Figure 3. The catalitically important ASP 25 and drug interacting with HOH 308 water molecule](1HSG_3.png)

> Q4: Water molecules normally have 3 atoms. Why do we see just one atom per water molecule in this structure?

The resolution of 1HSG is only 2.0 Å, and hydrogen atoms are even smaller. Thus, they are not shown (only the oxygen molecule of water is shown).

> Q5: There is a critical “conserved” water molecule in the binding site. Can you identify this water molecule? What residue number does this water molecule have?

HOH 308.

> Q6: Generate and save a figure clearly showing the two distinct chains of HIV-protease along with the ligand. You might also consider showing the catalytic residues ASP 25 in each chain and the critical water (we recommend “Ball & Stick” for these side-chains). Add this figure to your Quarto document.

Figure 3 above.

## Using the bio3d package in R

The Bio3D package is focused on structural bioinformatics analysis and allows us to read and analyze PDB (and related) data.

```{r}
library(bio3d)
```

```{r}
pdb <- read.pdb("1hsg")
pdb
```
> Q7: How many amino acid residues are there in this pdb object? 

198.

> Q8: Name one of the two non-protein residues? 

HOH and MK1.

> Q9: How many protein chains are in this structure?

2 (A and B).

```{r}
attributes(pdb)
```

We can see atom data with `pdb$atom`:

```{r}
head(pdb$atom)
```

```{r}
head(pdbseq(pdb))
```

## Visualization in R

We can make quick 3D viz with the `view.pdb()` function:

```{r}
library(bio3dview)
library(NGLVieweR)

view.pdb(pdb, backgroundColor = "pink", colorScheme = "sse")
```

```{r}
sel <- atom.select(pdb, resno=25)

view.pdb(pdb, cols=c("green", "orange"),
           highlight = sel,
         highlight.style = "spacefill") |>
  setRock()
```

## Predicting functional motions of a single structure

We can finish off today with a bioinformatics prediction of the functional motions of a protein.

We will run a Normal Mode Analysis (NMA)

```{r}
adk <- read.pdb("6s36")
adk
```

```{r}
m <- nma(adk)
plot(m)
```

```{r}
view.nma(m)
```

We can write-out a trajectory of the predicted dynamics and view this in Mol-star.

```{r}
mktrj(m, file="nma.pdb")
```
