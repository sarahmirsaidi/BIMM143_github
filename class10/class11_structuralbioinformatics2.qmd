Load up the packages we will need for analysis of protein structure sets.

```{r}
library(bio3d)
```

We will analyze the ADK starting with a single ADK database accession code: "1ake_A"

```{r}
id <- "1ake_A"
aa <- get.seq(id)
aa
```
Now we can search the PDB database to find all related enteries.
```{r}
blast <- blast.pdb(aa)
```

```{r}
attributes(blast)
```

```{r}
head(blast$hit.tbl)
```

Make a summary figure of the results.
```{r}
hits <- plot(blast)
```

Our "top hits" i.e. the most similar entries in the database are:
```{r}
hits$pdb.id
```

```{r}
# Download releated PDB files
files <- get.pdb(hits$pdb.id, path="pdbs", split=TRUE, gzip=TRUE)
```

Align and supperpose all these structures
```{r}
# Align releated PDBs
pdbs <- pdbaln(files, fit = TRUE, exefile="msa")
```

Side-note:
```{r}
library(bio3dview)

view.pdbs(pdbs)
```

This is better but still difficult to see what is similar and different in all these structures or to learn much about how this family works.

Let's try PCA:
```{r}
pc <- pca(pdbs)
plot(pc)
```

```{r}
plot(pc, pc.axes = 1:2)
```

```{r}
view.pca(pc)
```

Write a PDB "trajectory" for mol-star
```{r}
mktrj(pc, file="pca_results.pdb")
```
