## 1. Importing candy data

```{r}
candy <- read.csv("candy-data.txt", row.names=1)
head(candy)
```

> Q1. How many different candy types are in this dataset?

```{r}
nrow(candy)
```

There are 85 different candy types in this data set.

> Q2. How many fruity candy types are in the dataset?

```{r}
table(candy$fruity)
```
There are 38 fruity candy types in the dataset.

## 2. What is your favorate candy?

> Q3. What is your favorite candy in the dataset and what is it’s winpercent value?

```{r}
candy["Twix", ]$winpercent
```

> Q4. What is the winpercent value for “Kit Kat”?

```{r}
candy["Kit Kat", ]$winpercent
```

> Q5. What is the winpercent value for “Tootsie Roll Snack Bars”?

```{r}
candy["Tootsie Roll Snack Bars", ]$winpercent
```

## Exploratory Analysis

We can use the **skimr** package to get a quick overview of a given dataset. This can be useful for the first time you encounter a new dataset.

```{r}
skimr::skim(candy)
```
> Q6. Is there any variable/column that looks to be on a different scale to the majority of the other columns in the dataset?

Yes, the `candy$winpercent` column is on a 0-100 scale while all the others are on a 0-1 scale.

> Q7. What do you think a zero and one represent for the candy$chocolate column?

0 = the candy is not chocolate; 1 = the candy is chocolate.

> Q8. Plot a histogram of winpercent values

```{r}
hist(candy$winpercent)
```


> Q9. Is the distribution of winpercent values symmetrical?

No, the distribution is skewed to the left.

> Q10. Is the center of the distribution above or below 50%?

```{r}
summary(candy$winpercent)
```

The median is below 50%, but the mean (susceptible to outliers) is around 50%.

> Q11. On average is chocolate candy higher or lower ranked than fruit candy?

```{r}
choc.inds <- candy$chocolate == 1
choc.candy <- candy[choc.inds, ]
choc.win <- choc.candy$winpercent
mean(choc.win)
```

```{r}
fruity.inds <- candy$fruity == 1
fruity.candy <- candy[fruity.inds, ]
fruity.win <- fruity.candy$winpercent
mean(fruity.win)
```

On average, the chocolate candy is ranked higher than the fruity candy.

> Q12. Is this difference statistically significant?

```{r}
ans <- t.test(choc.win, fruity.win)
ans
```

```{r}
ans$p.value
```

Yes, with a p-value of `r ans$p.value` (<0.05).

## Overall Candy Rankings

> Q13. What are the five least liked candy types in this set?

There are two related functions that can help here. One is the classic `sort()` and the other is `order()`.

```{r}
x <- c(5, 10, 1, 4)
sort(x)
```

```{r}
order(x)
```

```{r}
inds <- order (candy$winpercent)
head(candy[inds,], 5)
```

> Q14. What are the top 5 all time favorite candy types out of this set?

```{r}
tail(candy[inds,], 5)
```

> Q15. Make a first barplot of candy ranking based on winpercent values.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(candy) + 
  aes(winpercent, rownames(candy)) +
  geom_col()
```

> Q16. This is quite ugly, use the reorder() function to get the bars sorted by winpercent?

```{r}
ggplot(candy) + 
  aes(winpercent, reorder(rownames(candy),winpercent)) +
  geom_col()
```

Custom Color Vector:
```{r}
my_cols=rep("black", nrow(candy))
my_cols[as.logical(candy$chocolate)] = "chocolate"
my_cols[as.logical(candy$bar)] = "brown"
my_cols[as.logical(candy$fruity)] = "pink"
```

```{r}
ggplot(candy) + 
  aes(winpercent, reorder(rownames(candy),winpercent)) +
  geom_col(fill=my_cols) 

ggsave("mybarplot.png", width=3, height=8)
```

![My silly barplot image](mybarplot.png)

> Q17. What is the worst ranked chocolate candy?

Sixlets.

> Q18. What is the best ranked fruity candy?

Starburst.

## 4. Taking a look at pricepercent

```{r}
library(ggrepel)

# Pink is too light, let's change to red
my_cols[as.logical(candy$fruity)] = "red"

# How about a plot of price vs win
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent, pricepercent, label=rownames(candy)) +
  geom_point(col=my_cols) + 
  geom_text_repel(col=my_cols, size=3.3, max.overlaps = 8)
```

```{r}
ord <- order(candy$pricepercent, decreasing = TRUE)
head( candy[ord,c(11,12)], n=5 )
```


> Q19. Which candy type is the highest ranked in terms of winpercent for the least money - i.e. offers the most bang for your buck?

Reese's Miniatures.

> Q20. What are the top 5 most expensive candy types in the dataset and of these which is the least popular?

Nik L Nip.

## 5. Correlation Structure

```{r}
cij <- cor(candy)
cij
```

```{r}
library(corrplot)

corrplot(cij)
```
> Q22. Examining this plot what two variables are anti-correlated (i.e. have minus values)?

Fruit and chocolate.

```{r}
round( cij["chocolate", "fruity"], 2)
```


> Q23. Similarly, what two variables are most positively correlated?

Chocolate and winpercent.

```{r}
round( cij["chocolate", "winpercent"], 2)
```

## 6. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

We need to be sure to scale our input  `candy` data before PCA as we have the `winpercent` column on a different scale to all others in the dataset.

```{r}
pca <- prcomp(candy, scale=T)
summary(pca)
```

First main result figure is my "PCA plot"

```{r}
ggplot(pca$x) +
  aes(PC1, PC2, label=rownames(pca$x)) +
  geom_point(col=my_cols) +
  geom_text_repel(max.overlaps = 6, col=my_cols) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(title="Halloween Candy PCA Space",
       subtitle="Colored by type: chocolate bar (dark brown), chocolate other (light brown), fruity (red), other (black)",
       caption="Data from 538")
```

The second main PCA result is in the `pca$rotation` we can plot this to generate a so-called "loadings" plot.

```{r}
ggplot(pca$rotation) +
  aes(PC1, reorder(rownames(pca$rotation), PC1), fill=PC1) +
  geom_col()
```


> Q24. What original variables are picked up strongly by PC1 in the positive direction? Do these make sense to you?

Fruity, hard, and pluribus. Yes, these make sense because they are correlated with each other (and not correlated with the other types of candy).
